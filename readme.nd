Bank Network Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Bank Network Infrastructure designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The aim of this project is to design a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture for a banking environment, including multiple departments, servers, and end devices.

The simulation focuses on basic networking concepts such as:

IP addressing

Routing and switching

VLANs

Server communication

End-to-end connectivity testing

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.0 or above recommended)

Networking devices:

Routers

Switches

PCs

Servers
